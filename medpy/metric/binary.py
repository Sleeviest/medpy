    This is not a real metric, as it is directed. See `assd` for a real metric of this.
    
    The method is implemented making use of distance images and simple binary morphology
    to achieve high computational speed.
    
    Examples
    --------
    The `connectivity` determines what pixels/voxels are considered the surface of a
    binary object. Take the following binary image showing a cross
    >>> from scipy.ndimage.morphology import generate_binary_structure
    >>> cross = generate_binary_structure(2, 1)
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])
    With `connectivity` set to `1` a 4-neighbourhood is considered when determining the
    object surface, resulting in
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 0, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])
    Changing `connectivity` to `2`, a 8-neighbourhood is considered and we get:
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])
    , as a diagonal connection does no longer qualifies as valid object surface.
    
    This influences the  results `asd` returns. Imagine we want to compute the surface
    distance of our cross to a cube-like object:
    >>>> cube = generate_binary_structure(2, 1)
    array([[1, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 1]])
    , which surface is, independent of the `connectivity` value set, always
    array([[1, 1, 1],
           [1, 0, 1],
           [1, 1, 1]])
           
    Using a `connectivity` of `1` we get
    >>>> asd(cross, cube, connectivity=1)
    0.0
    while a value of `2` returns uns
    >>>> asd(cross, cube, connectivity=2)
    0.20000000000000001
    due to the center of the cross being considered surface as well.
