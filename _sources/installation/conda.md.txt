Installing MedPy with Conda
===========================

**MedPy** does not come with an official conda package. But you can
nevertheless install it into a conda environement using *pip* after
resolving the dependencies.

``` {.bash}
conda install -c simpleitk simpleitk
python3 -m pip install medpy
```

Note that the graph-cut package won\'t compile in the conda environement
due to unmet dependencies.

For conda-purists: The friendly folks from
[bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) wrapped the previous (0.3.0)
version of **MedPy** into their distribution system (see
<https://anaconda.org/bioconda/medpy>).
